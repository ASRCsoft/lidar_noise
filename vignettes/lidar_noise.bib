	abstract = {Markov Random Fields in Image Segmentation introduces the fundamentals of Markovian modeling in image segmentation as well as providing a brief overview of recent advances in the field. Segmentation is considered in a common framework, called image labeling, where the problem is reduced to assigning labels to pixels. In a probabilistic approach, label dependencies are modeled by Markov random fields (MRF) and an optimal labeling is determined by Bayesian estimation, in particular maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. The main advantage of MRF models is that prior information can be imposed locally through clique potentials. The primary goal is to demonstrate the basic steps to construct an easily applicable MRF segmentation model and further develop its multiscale and hierarchical implementations as well as their combination in a multilayer model. MRF models usually yield a non-convex energy function. The minimization of this function is crucial in order to find the most likely segme tation according to the MRF model. Besides classical optimization algorithms like simulated annealing or deterministic relaxation, this book also presents recently introduced graph cut-based algorithms. It discusses the possible parallelization techniques of simulated annealing, which allows efficient implementation on, for example, GPU hardware without compromising convergence properties of the algorithms. While the main focus of this monograph is on generic model construction and related energy minimization methods, many sample applications are also presented to demonstrate the applicability of these models in real life problems such as remote sensing, biomedical imaging, change detection, and color- and motion-based segmentation. In real-life applications, parameter estimation is an important issue when implementing completely data-driven algorithms. Therefore some basic procedures, such as expectation-maximization, are also presented in the context of color image segmentation. Mar ov Random Fields in Image Segmentation is an essential companion for students, researchers and practitioners working on, or about to embark on research in statistical image segmentation.},

	abstract = {Noise removal is important in many applications. When the noise has impulsive characteristics, linear techniques do not perform well, and median filter or its derivatives are often used. Although median-based filters preserve edges reasonably well, they tend to remove some of the finer details in the image. Switching schemes--where the filter is switched between two or more filters--have been proposed, but they usually lack a decision rule efficient enough to yield good results on different regions of the image. In this paper we present a strategy to overcome this problem. A decision rule based on the second order local statistics of the signal (within a window) is used to switch between the identity filter and a median filter. The results on a test image show an improvement of around 4 dB over the median filter alone, and 2 dB over other techniques.},

	abstract = {A new framework for removing impulse noise from images is presented in which the nature of the filtering operation is conditioned on a state variable defined as the output of a classifier that operates on the differences between the input pixel and the remaining rank-ordered pixels in a sliding window. As part of this framework, several algorithms are examined, each of which is applicable to fixed and random-valued impulse noise models. First, a simple two-state approach is described in which the algorithm switches between the output of an identity filter and a rank-ordered mean (ROM) filter. The technique achieves an excellent tradeoff between noise suppression and detail preservation with little increase in computational complexity over the simple median filter. For a small additional cost in memory, this simple strategy is easily generalized into a multistate approach using weighted combinations of the identity and ROM filter in which the weighting coefficients can be optimized using image training data. Extensive simulations indicate that these methods perform significantly better in terms of noise suppression and detail preservation than a number of existing nonlinear techniques with as much as 40\% impulse noise corruption. Moreover, the method can effectively restore images corrupted with Gaussian noise and mixed Gaussian and impulse noise. Finally, the method is shown to be extremely robust with respect to the training data and the percentage of impulse noise},

	abstract = {Within the last two decades a small group of researchers has built a useful, nontrivial theory of nonlinear signal processing around the median-related filters known as rank-order filters, order-statistic filters, weighted median filters, and stack filters. This required significant effort to overcome the bias, both in education and research, toward linear theory, which has been dominant since the days of Fourier, Laplace, and “Convolute.”We trace the development of this theory of nonlinear filtering from its beginnings in the study of noise-removal properties and structural behavior of the median filter to the recently developed theory of optimal stack filtering.The theory of stack filtering provides a point of view which unifies many different filter classes, including morphological filters, so it is discussed in detail. Of particular importance is the way this theory has brought together, in a single analytical framework, both the estimation-based and the structural-based approaches to the design of these filters.Some recent applications of median and stack filters are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to nonlinear filtering. They include: the design of an optimal stack filter for image restoration; the use of vector median filters to attenuate impulsive noise in color images and to eliminate cross luminance and cross color in TV images; and the use of median-based filters for image sequence coding, reconstruction, and scan rate conversion in normal TV and HDTV systems.},

	abstract = {Current commercially available Doppler lidars provide an economical and robust solution for measuring vertical and horizontal wind velocities, together with the ability to provide co- and cross-polarised backscatter profiles. The high temporal resolution of these instruments allows turbulent properties to be obtained from studying the variation in radial velocities. However, the instrument specifications mean that certain characteristics, especially the background noise behaviour, become a limiting factor for the instrument sensitivity in regions where the aerosol load is low. Turbulent calculations require an accurate estimate of the contribution from velocity uncertainty estimates, which are directly related to the signal-to-noise ratio. Any bias in the signal-to-noise ratio will propagate through as a bias in turbulent properties. In this paper we present a method to correct for artefacts in the background noise behaviour of commercially available Doppler lidars and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio threshold used to discriminate between noise, and cloud or aerosol signals. We show that, for Doppler lidars operating continuously at a number of locations in Finland, the data availability can be increased by as much as 50 \% after performing this background correction and subsequent reduction in the threshold. The reduction in bias also greatly improves subsequent calculations of turbulent properties in weak signal regimes.},

	abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (“annealing”), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel “relaxation” algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

	abstract = {Doppler LiDAR measurements are already well established in the wind energy research and their accuracy has been tested against met mast data up to 100 m above ground. However, the new generation of scanning LiDAR have a much higher range and thus it is not possible to verify measurements at higher altitudes. Therefore, the LiDAR Measurement Campaign Sola (LIMECS) was conducted at the airport of Stavanger from March to August 2013 to compare LiDAR and radiosonde winds. It was a collaborative test campaign between the University of Bergen, the Norwegian Meteorological Office (MET), Christian Michelsen Research (CMR) and Avinor. With the airports’ location at the Norwegian West Coast, additional motivations were the investigations in characteristics of coastal winds, as well as the validation of the LES turbulence forecast for the airport of Stavanger. We deployed two Windcubes v1 and a scanning Windcube 100S at two different sites in Sola, one next to the runway and the other one near to the autosonde from MET. The Windcube 100S scans several cross-sections of the ambient flow on hourly basis. In combination with wind profiles up to 200 m (Windcubes v1) and 3km (Windcube 100S) and temporally more frequent radiosonde ascents, we collect a variety of wind information in the coastal atmospheric boundary layer. First results show increasing correlation of 0.95 to 0.99 for increasing measurement heights (125 to 1325 m) between the scanning LiDAR wind profiles and the radiosonde horizontal wind speeds. Though the number of LiDAR measurements decreases with increasing height, the measurements seem to correlate better with the radiosonde data in high altitudes.},

As wind turbines continue to grow in size, masts for mounting cup anemometers—the accepted standard for resource assessment—have necessarily become much taller, and much more expensive. This limitation has driven the commercialization of two remote sensing (RS) tools for the wind energy industry: The LIDAR and the SODAR, Doppler effect instruments using light and sound, respectively. They are ground-based and can work over hundreds of meters, sufficient for the tallest turbines in, or planned for, production. This study compares wind measurements from two commercial RS instruments against an instrumented mast, in upland (semi-complex) terrain typical of where many wind farms are now being installed worldwide. With appropriate filtering, regression analyses suggest a good correlation between the RS instruments and mast instruments: The RS instruments generally recorded lower wind speeds than the cup anemometers, with the LIDAR more accurate and the SODAR more precise.},

	abstract = {Visual information transmitted in the form of digital images is becoming a major method of communication in the modern age, but the image obtained after transmission is often corrupted with noise. The received image needs processing before it can be used in applications. Image denoising involves the manipulation of the image data to produce a visually high quality image. This thesis reviews the existing denoising algorithms, such as filtering approach, wavelet based approach, and multifractal approach, and performs their comparative study. Different noise models including additive and multiplicative types are used. They include Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, speckle noise and Brownian noise. Selection of the denoising algorithm is application dependent. Hence, it is necessary to have knowledge about the noise present in the image to select the appropriate denoising algorithm. The filtering approach has been proved to be the best when the image is corrupted with salt and pepper noise. The wavelet based approach finds applications in denoising images corrupted with Gaussian noise. In the case where the noise characteristics are complex, the multifractal approach can be used. A quantitative measure of comparison is provided by the signal to noise ratio of the image.},
